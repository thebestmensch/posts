# Intro
- Definition
[Someone](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-product-management-important) smarter than I am defined product management as "making sure your product effectively serves your customers and accomplishes your business objectives, and continues to do so over time." Simple, right? Just go do the thing, do it so everyone likes it, and continue to do it indefinitely. Unfortunately, harder said than done. Product management requires combining communication, estimation, and management skills in a deliberate and mindful manner. Let's take a look at some of those skills.
