Perfectionism is a common trait in high performers and the pressure is on to be a high performer in tech. Corporations like Google and Facebook offer insane perks to attract the best of the best. Venture Capitalists are investing in stellar teams rather than ideas on the napkin. It's difficult to come to terms with what has been one of the reasons for your career status so far is now what's hurting your business and your team. I live by a few principals that keep me (mostly) sane and remind me that "good enough" is all we need right now.

<br/>

## Everything is a negotiation

If you managed people in a corporate setting, you are probably used to being responsible for their output velocity and quality. Processes were probably in place to accurately track average vs current velocity and course correct where appropriate. You had teams of experts for each business unit. You probably have "managed X people" as a highlight on your resume. Unfortunately very little of that applies to your current situation and your startup. (mini rant over)

Team dynamics at a startup is all about understanding that everyone has to wear multiple hats, everyone has different perspectives on what has to be done at what priority, and ultimately each task that the team spends their precious time on should be a negotiation between every relevent teammate.

<br/>

## Learn to be good with "good enough"

If you have ever worked with a capable, self-reflecting engineer (or one with a boss that poorly understands how estimating software works), you've probably heard of the [Pareto Principal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) (more commonly known as the 80/20 rule) and the [90/90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninety-ninety_rule). Both principals utlimately imply that there is a point at which a task is "good enough", and taking it from that point to 100% is not worth the time to do so. Let's illustrate with an example:

> Sally is working on a sales strategy for the first round of potential customers. She developed messaging she thought was good enough in a few hours. She brought it to the team, and then they internally iterated on the > > messaging for three days. The customers didn't respond well and they ended up changing the messaging.

The point here is that "done" and "100% complete" should almost always be mutually exclusive if you work at a start up. Releasing something in a day that allows you to get feedback sooner is always going to be better than taking a week to perfect something that's mostly likely going to change anyways.

<br/>

## Check your pride at the door

Get your users involved as early as possible! I cannot stress this enough. Luckily, if you're following the principals I referenced above, you're probably doing this already. But if you aren't, check your pride and start reaching out to early users of your product. Make them feel included and valued, accept feedback and learn as much as you can about how your users are actually using your product. THey're your target market. They know more about what they want than you do.

Investors probably don't want you calling them weekly asking if they've created an account yet, but you still need to be looping them in on the good and the bad things that happen.

<br/>

## Final Thoughts

The common theme here is humility. Corporations turn coworkesr into competitors, but in a startup it is the opposite. You need to trust that your teammates, users, and investors all have valuable opinions and perspectives. If you don't, it won't be long until you end up back in middle management.
